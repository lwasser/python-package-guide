# Python package structure information

### Python packaging resources that we love 

We think the resources below are excellent but each have particular opinions 
that you may or may not find in our packaging guide. For instance, the PyPA
guide encourages users to store their package in a `src/package-name` directory.
While we accept that approach many of our community members prefer to not use 
the `src` directory.

* [PyPA packaging guide](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/)
```

If you plan to submit a package for review to pyOpenSci and are looking for 
some guidance on package structure, code formats and style, then this section is for you. 


```{note}
If you are considering submitting a package to pyOpenSci, or if you are just 
getting started with building a package, you may want to have a look at the 
bare-minimum [editor checks.](open-source-software-submissions/editor-in-chief-guide.html#editor-checklist-copy-template-below-to-use-in-the-issue) that pyOpenSci
performs before a review even begins. 

In general these are basic items that should be in any open software repository.

## Packaging Guide


PyPI also has a [short tutorial](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/)
on how to package a Python project for easy installation.


<!-- 

These checks include several items

- **Sufficient Documentation** The package has sufficient documentation available online (README, sphinx docs) to allow us to evaluate package function and scope *without installing the package*. This includes:
  Get started tutorials or vignettes that help a user understand how to use the package and what it can do for them (often these have a name like "Getting started")
- **API documentation** - this includes clearly written doc strings with variables defined using a standard docstring format -->
