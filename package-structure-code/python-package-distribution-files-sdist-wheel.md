# What is a SDist and Wheel? About Python Package Distribution Files

This pages will help you understand the two core packaging files
that you need to create to publish your Python package to
PyPI - the Source Distribution (SDist) and the Wheel (.whl).

## Source vs. Binary Files

To begin, it's important to understand the two "types" of
distribution files. When it comes to packaging, you can think about files as either source or
binary:

**Source files:** source files are the unbuilt files needed to build your
package. These are the "raw / as-is" files that you store on GitHub or whatever
platform you are using to manage your code repository.
**Binary files:** binary files are the source files after they've been built. These files have been compiled (if they require compilation) and are ready
to be installed.

### Python package distribution types: SDist and Wheels
There are two types of distribution files that you will create to support
publishing your Python package on PyPI:

1. SDist and
1. Wheel

<!--
* **SDist (Source Distribution):** This file, packaged as a **.tar.gz** tarball represents all of the unbuilt source files needed to build your package into an installable bundle. But the files within the package are not yet "built" if your package requires a  build step. Pure python packages most often do not require a build step.
* **Wheel:** A wheel (**.whl**) is a **.zip** file containing all of the files needed to directly install your package. All of the files in a wheel are binaries - this means that code is already compiled / built. Wheels are thus faster to install - particularly if you have a package that requires build steps. -->

```{note}
If your package is a pure python package with no additional
build / compilation steps then the SDIST and Wheel files will have
similar content.
```

### What is a SDist file?

SDist, short for **S**ource **D**istribution file is a packaged file in `.tar.gz`
format (often called a "tarball") that has all of the files needed to build your
package. In the SDist format, your package's files are not included in a built
format. Thus, anyone using this file, will have to build the files first before
they can be installed.

<!-- TODO: will work on cleaning up this after adding MANIFEST and then
add a section on the MANIFEST file for packaging and link to

```{tip}
When you make a release on GitHub, it creates a SDist file (`.tar.gz`) that
anyone can download and use.
```

<!--
* one of the benefits of wheel is pretty much avoiding setup.py which
has code mixed in. makes you more vulnerable to a code injection on install.

assuming this means if the package is already pre-built than setup.py isn't running anything on install because install is just moving files across to the machine to be run.

And having metadata separate allows someone to view the metadata without
running any python code as it's a machine and human readable format.

### Wheel (.whl files):

A wheel or `.whl` file, is a zipped file that has
the extension `.whl`. The wheel does not contain any of your packages
configuration files such as **setup.cfg** or **pyproject.toml**. This distribution
is already built so it's ready to install.

Because it is prebuilt, the wheel file will be faster to install for pure Python
projects and can lead to consistent installs across machines.

```{tip}
Wheels are also useful in the case that a package
needs a **setup.py** file to support a more complex built.
In this case, because the files in the wheel bundle
are pre built, the user installing doesn't have to
work about malicious code injections when it is installed.
```

The filename of a wheel contains important metadata about your package.

Example: **stravalib-1.1.0.post2-py3-none.whl**

* packageName: stravalib
* packageVersion: 1.1.0
* build-number: 2 (post2) [(read more about post here)](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/#post-release-separators)
* py3: supports Python 3.x
* none: is not operating system specific (runs on windows, mac, linux)
* any: runs on any computer processor / architecture
