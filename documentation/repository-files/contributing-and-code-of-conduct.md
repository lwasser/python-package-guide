# Contributing and Code of Conduct Files in your Python Open Source Package

A healthy Python package repository (or any open source software repository) should also have a: 

* Contributing.md file
* A License file and 
* A CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file 
* A development guide (if possible)

## What a CONTRIBUTING.md file should contain

Your Python open source package should include a file called **CONTRIBUTING.md** located in the 
root of your repository (with your **README.md** file).

The contributing file should include information about the types 
of contributions that you welcome, and how you'd like to see 
contributions happen. 

This guide should also include information for someone interested in asking questions, 
submitting issues or pull requests:

* Any guidelines that you have in place for users submitting issues, pull requests or asking questions. 
* A link to your code of conduct
* A link to licensing information found in your README file. 
* A link to a development guide if you have one


## The CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file
Your package should have a CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file located 
the root of the repository. If you are not comfortable creating 
your own code of conduct text, we encourage you to adopt the 
code of conduct language used in the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/). 
[Many other communities](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/adopters/) have adopted this code of conduct as 
their own including the [Fatiando](https://github.com/fatiando/community/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) scientific geoscience community.
