# Document the code in your package's API using docstrings

## What is an API?
API stands for **A**pplied **P**rogramming **I**nterface. When
discussed in the context of a (Python) package, the API refers to
the functions, methods and classes that a package maintainer creates for users.

A simple example of a package API element:
For instance, a package might have a function called `add_numbers()`
that adds up a bunch of numbers. To add up numbers, you as the user
simply call `add_numbers(1,2,3)` and the package function calculates the value and returns `6`. By calling the `add_numbers` function, you are
using the package's API.

Package APIs consist of functions and/or classes, methods and attributes that create a user interface (known as the API).

## What is a docstring and how does it relate to documentation?
In Python a docstring refers to text in a function, method or class
that describes what the function does and its inputs and outputs. Python programmers usually refer to the inputs to functions as ["parameters"](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-parameter) or ["arguments"](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/programming.html#faq-argument-vs-parameter), and the outputs are often called "return values"

The docstring is thus important for:

* When you call `help()` in Python, for example, `help(add_numbers)`, the text of the function's docstring is printed. The docstring thus helps a user better understand how to applying the function more effectively to their workflow.
* When you build your package's documentation, the docstrings can be also used to automagically create full API documentation that provides a clean view of all its functions, methods, attributes, and classes.

```{tip}
Example API Documentation for all functions, methods, attributes and classes in a package.
* [View example high level API documentation for the Verde package. This page lists every function and class in the package along with a brief explanation of what it does](https://www.fatiando.org/verde/latest/api/index.html)
* [You can further dig down to see what a specific function does within the package by clicking on an API element](https://www.fatiando.org/verde/latest/api/generated/verde.grid_coordinates.html#verde.grid_coordinates)
```

## Python package API documentation

If you have a descriptive docstring for every user-facing
class, method, attribute and/or function in your package (*within reason*), then your package's API is considered well-documented.

In Python, this means that you need to add a docstring for
every user-facing
class, method, attribute and/or function in your package (*within reason*) that:

* Explains what the function, method, attribute or class does
* Defines the `type` inputs and outputs (ie. `string`, `int`, `np.array`)
* Explains the expected output `return` of the object, method or function.

### Three Python docstring formats and why we like NumPy style

There are several Python docstring formats that you can chose to use when documenting
your package including:

* [NumPy-style](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html#docstring-standard)
* [google style](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html)
* [reST style](https://sphinx-rtd-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docstrings.html)

<!-- https://peps.python.org/pep-0287/ - 2002 pep 287-->
We suggest using [NumPy-style docstrings](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html#docstring-standard) for your
Python documentation because:

* NumPy style docstrings are core to the scientific Python ecosystem and defined in the [NumPy style guide](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html). Thus you will find them widely used there.
* The Numpy style docstring is simplified and thus easier-to-read both in the code and when calling `help()` in Python. In contrast, some  feel that reST style docstrings is harder to quickly scan, and can take up more lines of code in modules.

```{tip}
If you are using NumPy style docstrings, be sure to include the [sphinx napoleon
extension](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/napoleon.html) in your documentation `conf.py` file. This extension allows Sphinx
to properly read and format NumPy format docstrings.
```

### Docstring examples Better and Best

Below is a good example of a well documented function. Notice that this
function's docstring describes the function's inputs and the function's output
(or return value). The initial description of the function is short (one line).
Following that single line description there is a slightly longer description of
what the function does (2 to 3 sentences). The return of the function is also
specified.

```Python
def extent_to_json(ext_obj):
    """Convert bounds to a shapely geojson like spatial object.

    This format is what shapely uses. The output object can be used
    to crop a raster image.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ext_obj : list or geopandas.GeoDataFrame
        If provided with a `geopandas.GeoDataFrame`, the extent
        will be generated from that. Otherwise, extent values
        should be in the order: minx, miny, maxx, maxy.

    Returns
    -------
    extent_json: A GeoJSON style dictionary of corner coordinates
    for the extent
        A GeoJSON style dictionary of corner coordinates representing
        the spatial extent of the provided spatial object.
    """
```

### Best: a docstring with example use of the function

This example contains an example of using the function that is also tested in
sphinx using [doctest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html).

```Python
def extent_to_json(ext_obj):
    """Convert bounds to a shapely geojson like spatial object.

    This format is what shapely uses. The output object can be used
    to crop a raster image.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ext_obj : list or geopandas.GeoDataFrame
        If provided with a `geopandas.GeoDataFrame`, the extent
        will be generated from that. Otherwise, extent values
        should be in the order: minx, miny, maxx, maxy.

    Returns
    -------
    extent_json : A GeoJSON style dictionary of corner coordinates
    for the extent
        A GeoJSON style dictionary of corner coordinates representing
        the spatial extent of the provided spatial object.

    Example
    -------
    Convert a `geopandas.GeoDataFrame` to an extent dictionary:

    >>> import geopandas as gpd
    >>> import earthpy.spatial as es
    >>> from earthpy.io import path_to_example

	We start by loading a Shapefile.

    >>> rmnp = gpd.read_file(path_to_example('rmnp.shp'))

	And then use `extent_to_json` to do the conversion from `shp` to
    `geopandas.GeoDataFrame`.

    >>> es.extent_to_json(rmnp)
    {'type': 'Polygon', 'coordinates': (((-105.4935937, 40.1580827), ...),)}

    """

```

```{figure} /images/sphinx-rendering-extent-to-json-earthpy.png
---
name: earthpy-json-example
width: 80%
---
Using the above NumPy format docstring in sphinx, the autodoc extension will
create the about documentation section for the `extent_to_json` function. The
output of the `es.extent_to_json(rmnp)` command can even be tested using
doctest adding another quality check to your package.
```


## Using doctest to run docstring examples in your package's methods and functions
<!-- This link isn't working no matter how i create the target. not sure
why -->
Above, we provided some examples of good, better, best docstring formats. If you are using Sphinx to create your docs, you can add the [doctest](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/doctest.html) extension to your Sphinx build. Doctest provides an additional; check for docstrings with example code in them.
Doctest runs the example code in your docstring `Examples` checking
that the expected output is correct. Similar to running
tutorials in your documentation, `doctest` can be a useful step that
assures that your package's code (API) runs as you expect it to.

```{note}
It's important to keep in mind that examples in your docstrings
help users using your package. Running `doctest` on those examples provides a
check of your package's API. doctest ensures that the functions and methods in your package
run as you expect them to. Neither of these items replace a separate,
stand-alone test suite that is designed to test your package's core functionality
across operating systems and Python versions.
```

Below is an example of a docstring with an example.
doctest will run the example below and test that if you provide
`add_me` with the values 1 and 3 it will return 4.


```python
def add_me(aNum, aNum2):
    """A function that prints a number that it is provided.

    Parameters
    ----------
    aNum : int
        An integer value to be printed

    Returns
    -------
        Prints the integer that you provide the function.

    Examples
    --------
    Below you can see how the `print_me` function will print a number that
    you provide it.

    >>> add_me(1+3)
    4

    """

    return aNum + aNum2


```


## Beyond docstrings: type hints

We can use docstrings to describe data types that we pass into functions as parameters or 
into classes as attributes. We do it with package users in mind.

What with us â€“ developers? We can think of ourselves and the new contributors 
and start using *type hinting* to make our journey safer!

There are solid reasons why to use type hints:

- Development and debugging is faster,
- We clearly see data flow and its transformations,
- We can use tools like `mypy` or integrated tools of Python IDEs for static type checking and code debugging.

We should consider type hinting if our package performs data processing, 
functions require complex inputs, and we want to lower the entrance barrier for our contributors. 
The icing on the cake is that the code in our package will be aligned with the best industry standards.

But there are reasons to *skip* type hinting:

- Type hints may make code unreadable, especially when a parameterâ€™s input takes multiple data types and we list them all,
- It doesnâ€™t make sense to write type hints for simple scripts and functions that perform obvious operations.

Fortunately for us, type hinting is not all black and white. 
We can gradually describe the parameters and outputs of some functions but leave others as they are. 
Type hinting can be an introductory task for new contributors in seasoned packages, 
that way their learning curve about data flow and dependencies between API endpoints will be smoother.

## Type hints in practice

Type hinting was introduced with Python 3.5 and is described in [PEP 484](https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/). 
**PEP 484** defines the scope of type hinting. Is Python drifting towards compiled languages with type hinting?
It is not. Type hints are optional and static and they will work like that in the future where Python is Python.
The power of type hints lies somewhere between docstrings and unit tests, and with it we can avoid many bugs 
throughout development.

We've seen type hints in the simple example earlier, and we will change it slightly:


```python
from typing import Dict, List


def extent_to_json(ext_obj: List) -> Dict:
    """Convert bounds to a shapely geojson like spatial object."""
    pass
```

Here we focus on the new syntax. First, we have described the parameter `ext_obj` as the `List` class. How do we do it? By adding a colon after parameter and the name of a class that is passed into a function. Itâ€™s not over and we see that the function definition after closing parenthesis is expanded. If we want to inform type checker what type function returns, then we create the arrow sign `->` that points to a returned type and after it we have functionâ€™s colon. Our function returns Python dictonray (`Dict`).

```{note}
We have exported classes `List` and `Dict` from `typing` module but we may use 
`list` or `dict` keywords instead. We will achieve the same result. 
Capitalized keywords are required when our package uses Python versions that are lower than
Python 3.9. Python 3.7 will be deprecated in June 2023, Python 3.8 in October 2024.
Thus, if your package supports the whole ecosystem, it should use `typing` module syntax.
```

### Type hints: basic example

The best way to learn is by example. We will use the [pystiche](https://github.com/pystiche/pystiche/tree/main) package.
To avoid confusion, we start from a mathematical operation with basic data types:

```python
import torch


def _norm(x: torch.Tensor, dim: int = 1, eps: float = 1e-8) -> torch.Tensor:
    ...

```

The function has three parameters:

- `x` that is required and its type is `torch.Tensor`,
- `dim`, optional `int` with a default value equal to `1`,
- `eps`, optional `float` with a default value equal to `1e-8`.

As we see, we can use basic data types to mark simple variables. The basic set of those types is:

- `int`,
- `float`,
- `str`,
- `bool`
- `complex`.

Most frequently we will use those types within a simple functions that are *close to data*.
However, sometimes our variable will be a data structure that isn't built-in within Python itself 
but comes from other packages:

- `Tensor` from `pytorch`,
- `ndarray` from `numpy`,
- `DataFrame` from `pandas`,
- `Session` from `requests`.

To perform type checking we must import those classes, then we can set those as a parameter's type.
The same is true if we want to use classes from within our package (but we should avoid **circular imports**, 
the topic that we will uncover later).
