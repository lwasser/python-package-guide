# How to publish your Python package documentation online

We suggest that you setup a hosting service for your Python package 
documentation. Two free and commonly used ways to
quickly create a documentation website hosting environment are below. 

1. You can host your documentation yourself using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) or another online hosting service. 
1. You can host your documentation using [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/).

If you don't want to maintain a documentation website for your Python package, 
we suggest using the Read the Docs website. Read the Docs allows you to:

* Quickly launch a website using the documentation found in your GitHub repository.  
* Track versions of your documentation as you release updates.
* Provides support for Google analytics.
* Allows you to turn on integration with pull requests where you can view documentation build progress (success vs failure).
