# potentiall drop this lesson? Add a LICENSE file to your Python package

TODO: this may not be a needed lesson because that file can be added when you create a new repo.
Question: can you add a license after the fact via github??

If you created your package repository on GitHub, then you may have already
selected a license to use and thus may already have a LICENSE file in your
repository. If that is the case, you can skip this lesson.

- Where do most people start? if they start by creating a new github repo, the license and readme are a part of the options.
