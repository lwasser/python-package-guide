## About

This guide is designed to guide you through your Python packaging experience.

It does several things:

1. it provides an overview of the various elements of a python package
2. it provides and overview of tools to create python packages and recommends best practices
3. it provides end-to-end tutorials to get you on your way creating a package

### pyOpenSci's packaging goals

Our goal is to help the
community make decisions around how to create scientific Python packages. We are working towards a shared vision of packaging that helps users better understand where to start.

### How this guide is created

This guide is created by pyOpenSci through an extensive review process. Each page in the guide has been reviewed by experts in the broader Python packaging landscape including people from:

- conda & conda-forge
- the python packaging authority
- core Python developers
- core scientific Python developers
- and others with expertise in packaging, package documentation, usability and other related knowledge areas

[View all of the people who have contributed to this guide here.

We use this guide as a foundation for our open peer review process of
scientific software.

## Who this guidebook is for

We assume that you are here because you are:

1. Looking for guidance on creating a Python package.
1. Looking for resources associated with Python packaging.
1. Considering submitting a package to pyOpenSci and want to understand what we are looking for when we review your package

Well, friend, you've come to the right place!

<img src="/images/python-flying-xkcd.png" alt="xkcd comic showing a stick figure on the ground and one in the air. The one on the ground is saying. `You're flying! how?`  The person in the air replies  `Python!` Below is a 3 rectangle comic with the following text in each box. box 1 - I learned it last night. Everything is so simple. Hello world is just print hello world. box 2 - the person on the ground says - come join us programming is fun again. it's a whole new world. But how are you flying? box 3 - the person flying says - i just typed import antigravity. I also sampled everything in the medicine cabinet. But i think this is the python. the person on the ground is saying - that's it?" width="400px">

Many love to use Python because it is a clean language to learn. It also is incredibly flexible allowing it to be used across numerous domains. Source: xkcd comics.

## What you will find in this guidebook

This guidebook contains:

- Explanation for "Good enough" minimum requirements associated with being reviewed by pyOpenSci
- Explanation of better and best practices in case you want to set the bar higher for your package (which we hope you will)!
- A curated list of resources to help you get your package into documented, usable and tested shape.

## Where this guide is headed

Most of the sections in this guide will ultimately include Good/Better/Best recommendations for Python open source software packaging.

Good meets the requirements. Going beyond the minimum can make package maintenance easier-to-use for new users, easier-to contribute for new contributors and easier-to-maintain for you.

This guide is a work in progress. If you have ideas of things you'd like
to see here, [we invite you to open an issue on GitHub that details any changes or additions that you'd like to see.](https://github.com/pyOpenSci/python-package-guide/issues).
